send chat message?
1. easier: search for "ChatSend", go inside the callback provided, and there should be a call to send_chat
2. if 1 not possible: bp on RiotLauncher!MaestroGameController_SendChatMessage, go up a several functions and you're there

FloatingText
1. put a hardware breakpoint on "Level Up!"
2. search for "game_floatingtext_levelup", or "game_floatingtext_quest_received". 
   it is moved into ecx, and than there is a call to expand_macro. after this call, there is a call to floating_text

main_loop
search for "GAMESTATE_GAMELOOP Begin" string. the function that uses this string is called by the main loop

CastSpell (check calling convention)
1. search for "ERROR: Client Tried to cast a spell from an invalid slot: %d."
2. search for "ALE-229C053F"
* note: you can find main_champion and offset for cast_spell_this in main champion by looking who called CastSpell

SpellManager
1. Find references to CastSpell. some one down the road converts spell index to spellInfo by looking at main_object + x + spellIndex*4.
   Find x. it should be near the string "ALE-C00960B2"

AttackMove
1.  	(not working ?) the cursor xzy is stored in memory. after it there is the xzy of the last click.
	hardware bp there and see who changes it. should be close to AttackMove (no need to go up the stack, should be in the same function
	it breaks on)
2.	search for "ALE-E63471E6". it is only used by a function that gets called by attackmove only, so should be easy

List of Objects:
1. find "Starting GameWorld". this string is moved into ecx before call to a function. the function after this function is
   initialize_object_list. in this function, there is and instruction "mov edi, 4". after this there is a "mov my_object_count, 0".
   find references for my_object_count, and go to the increase one.
   before the increase, there is a "mov [eax + ecx*4], esi". eax is my_object_list - there should be a "mov eax, my_object_list"  somewhere near
